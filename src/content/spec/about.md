# About Me

👋 Hey there! I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast and researcher on a mission to make the digital world a safer place!

## 🛡️ My Focus Areas:
- **Web Application Security**: I dive deep into the code, hunting down vulnerabilities like a digital detective.
- **Active Directory Security**: Ensuring that the gates are locked and only the right folks get in!
- **Digital Forensics**: Unraveling mysteries from the digital crime scene—think of me as the Sherlock Holmes of cyberspace.

## 🎮 CTF Lover:
When I’m not deep in research, you can find me tackling Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. Each challenge is a puzzle waiting to be solved, and I’m all about that adrenaline rush!

## 📚 Currently Learning:
I’m currently on the path to achieving my **CPTS certification**. Every day is a new opportunity to level up my skills and knowledge!
